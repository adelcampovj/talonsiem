# TalonSIEM

A lightweight, terminal-based Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.

**TalonSIEM** parses log files like `auth.log`, detects brute-force login attempts using regex, stores the data in SQLite, exports alerts to CSV, and sends real-time email alerts â€” all in a single Python script.

## Usage

If you change the auth.log file and want TalonSIEM to scan the new log, you should delete the old database first:

```bash
rm talonsiem.db
```

This will let the program start fresh and create a new database with the new log entries.

## Installation

This is a Python-based project. To install and run it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/talonsiem.git
cd talonsiem
python3 -m venv venv
